    <h3>Digicam is telling me that my selected image is not supported</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Digicam only supports "baseline" (not "progressive", or "interlaced") JPEGs. Here are some tips to make your photo compatible:</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Using Photoshop:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to File > Export > Save for Web (Legacy)</li>
                <li>Change the format to JPEG. Make sure to uncheck 'Progressive' and 'Optimized'.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Using Paint.NET:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to File -> Save As...</li>
                <li>Change the 'Save as type' to JPEG, and save.</li>
                <li>You do not need to change any options - Paint.NET does not support progressive JPEGs, and will save as baseline.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
