    <h3>A channel is informing me I need to install Set Personal Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Please follow <a href="{{ site.guide }}">our installation guide</a> to use the patcher. From there, you will be able to install the Set Personal Data channel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What does this service do?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>he original "Set Personal Data" channel does not work well on non-Japanese Wiis, so we made our own.</li>
        <li>This allows you to set information such as your first/last name, and an email address.</li>
        <li>Many other channels require it to be installed so that they can access address information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Set Personal Data is telling me that my address is within "Dallas, TX"</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This is the default address. You are welcome to update it to your own!</li>
    </ul>
