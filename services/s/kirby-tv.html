    <h3>Kirby TV Channel freezes on the Now Showing page, what do I do?</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>If you find that the Kirby TV Channel is freezing when you get to the "Now Showing" screen, that's because all of the Kirby: Right Back At Ya' episodes have finished airing!</li>
        <li>We are working on a rerun for the channel, so stay tuned for when we make an announcement about that in our <a href="{{ site.discord }}">Discord server</a> or on <a href="{{ site.twitter }}">Twitter</a>.</li>
